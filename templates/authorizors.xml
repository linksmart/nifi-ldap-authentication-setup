        The LdapUserGroupProvider will retrieve users and groups from an LDAP server. The users and groups
        are not configurable.
        'Authentication Strategy' - How the connection to the LDAP server is authenticated. Possible
            values are ANONYMOUS, SIMPLE, LDAPS, or START_TLS.
        'Manager DN' - The DN of the manager that is used to bind to the LDAP server to search for users.
        'Manager Password' - The password of the manager that is used to bind to the LDAP server to
            search for users.
        'TLS - Keystore' - Path to the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Password' - Password for the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP
            using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Keystore Type' - Type of the Keystore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Truststore' - Path to the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Password' - Password for the Truststore that is used when connecting to
            LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
        'TLS - Truststore Type' - Type of the Truststore that is used when connecting to LDAP using
            LDAPS or START_TLS (i.e. JKS or PKCS12).
        'TLS - Client Auth' - Client authentication policy when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS.
            Possible values are REQUIRED, WANT, NONE.
        'TLS - Protocol' - Protocol to use when connecting to LDAP using LDAPS or START_TLS. (i.e. TLS,
            TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, etc).
        'TLS - Shutdown Gracefully' - Specifies whether the TLS should be shut down gracefully
            before the target context is closed. Defaults to false.
        'Referral Strategy' - Strategy for handling referrals. Possible values are FOLLOW, IGNORE, THROW.
        'Connect Timeout' - Duration of connect timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).
        'Read Timeout' - Duration of read timeout. (i.e. 10 secs).
        'Url' - Space-separated list of URLs of the LDAP servers (i.e. ldap://<hostname>:<port>).
        'Page Size' - Sets the page size when retrieving users and groups. If not specified, no paging is performed.
        'Sync Interval' - Duration of time between syncing users and groups (i.e. 30 mins). Minimum allowable value is 10 secs.
        'User Search Base' - Base DN for searching for users (i.e. ou=users,o=nifi). Required to search users.
        'User Object Class' - Object class for identifying users (i.e. person). Required if searching users.
        'User Search Scope' - Search scope for searching users (ONE_LEVEL, OBJECT, or SUBTREE). Required if searching users.
        'User Search Filter' - Filter for searching for users against the 'User Search Base' (i.e. (memberof=cn=team1,ou=groups,o=nifi) ). Optional.
        'User Identity Attribute' - Attribute to use to extract user identity (i.e. cn). Optional. If not set, the entire DN is used.
        'User Group Name Attribute' - Attribute to use to define group membership (i.e. memberof). Optional. If not set
            group membership will not be calculated through the users. Will rely on group membership being defined
            through 'Group Member Attribute' if set. The value of this property is the name of the attribute in the user ldap entry that
            associates them with a group. The value of that user attribute could be a dn or group name for instance. What value is expected
            is configured in the 'User Group Name Attribute - Referenced Group Attribute'.
        'User Group Name Attribute - Referenced Group Attribute' - If blank, the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute'
            is expected to be the full dn of the group. If not blank, this property will define the attribute of the group ldap entry that
            the value of the attribute defined in 'User Group Name Attribute' is referencing (i.e. name). Use of this property requires that
            'Group Search Base' is also configured.
        'Group Search Base' - Base DN for searching for groups (i.e. ou=groups,o=nifi). Required to search groups.
        'Group Object Class' - Object class for identifying groups (i.e. groupOfNames). Required if searching groups.
        'Group Search Scope' - Search scope for searching groups (ONE_LEVEL, OBJECT, or SUBTREE). Required if searching groups.
        'Group Search Filter' - Filter for searching for groups against the 'Group Search Base'. Optional.
        'Group Name Attribute' - Attribute to use to extract group name (i.e. cn). Optional. If not set, the entire DN is used.
        'Group Member Attribute' - Attribute to use to define group membership (i.e. member). Optional. If not set
            group membership will not be calculated through the groups. Will rely on group membership being defined
            through 'User Group Name Attribute' if set. The value of this property is the name of the attribute in the group ldap entry that
            associates them with a user. The value of that group attribute could be a dn or memberUid for instance. What value is expected
            is configured in the 'Group Member Attribute - Referenced User Attribute'. (i.e. member: cn=User 1,ou=users,o=nifi vs. memberUid: user1)
        'Group Member Attribute - Referenced User Attribute' - If blank, the value of the attribute defined in 'Group Member Attribute'
            is expected to be the full dn of the user. If not blank, this property will define the attribute of the user ldap entry that
            the value of the attribute defined in 'Group Member Attribute' is referencing (i.e. uid). Use of this property requires that
            'User Search Base' is also configured. (i.e. member: cn=User 1,ou=users,o=nifi vs. memberUid: user1)
        NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the user identities.
            Group names are not mapped.

    <!--
        The FileAccessPolicyProvider will provide support for managing access policies which is backed by a file
        on the local file system.
        - User Group Provider - The identifier for an User Group Provider defined above that will be used to access
            users and groups for use in the managed access policies.
        - Authorizations File - The file where the FileAccessPolicyProvider will store policies.
        - Initial Admin Identity - The identity of an initial admin user that will be granted access to the UI and
            given the ability to create additional users, groups, and policies. The value of this property could be
            a DN when using certificates or LDAP, or a Kerberos principal. This property will only be used when there
            are no other policies defined. If this property is specified then a Legacy Authorized Users File can not be specified.
            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the initial admin identity,
            so the value should be the unmapped identity. This identity must be found in the configured User Group Provider.
        - Legacy Authorized Users File - The full path to an existing authorized-users.xml that will be automatically
            converted to the new authorizations model. If this property is specified then an Initial Admin Identity can
            not be specified, and this property will only be used when there are no other users, groups, and policies defined.
            NOTE: Any users in the legacy users file must be found in the configured User Group Provider.
        - Node Identity [unique key] - The identity of a NiFi cluster node. When clustered, a property for each node
            should be defined, so that every node knows about every other node. If not clustered these properties can be ignored.
            The name of each property must be unique, for example for a three node cluster:
            "Node Identity A", "Node Identity B", "Node Identity C" or "Node Identity 1", "Node Identity 2", "Node Identity 3"
            NOTE: Any identity mapping rules specified in nifi.properties will also be applied to the node identities,
            so the values should be the unmapped identities (i.e. full DN from a certificate). This identity must be found
            in the configured User Group Provider.
        - Node Group - The name of a group containing NiFi cluster nodes. The typical use for this is when nodes are dynamically
            added/removed from the cluster.
            NOTE: The group must exist before starting NiFi.
